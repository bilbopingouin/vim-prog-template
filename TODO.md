# TODO

### Scope

In order to avoid collision with potentially other plugins, we need to fix the scope of the functions/variables as much as possible

### Specific files

Some specific functions look for specific files in the templates directory, those should be configurable as well

### Test config

Test whether it it possible to define another configuration file
